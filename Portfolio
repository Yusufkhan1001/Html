    <h2>hobby</h2>
    <p> <strong>1. Video Games  </strong>
   I enjoy playing video games as they boost my problem-solving skills, reflexes, and creativity. It’s also a great way to relax and connect with others online.<br>

2.  <strong>Bike Riding  </strong>
   Riding bikes keeps me active and gives me a sense of freedom and adventure. It’s not just exercise, but a way to explore new places and clear my mind.<br>

3. <strong>Video Editing  </strong>
   I love editing videos because it allows me to tell stories visually. I enjoy turning raw clips into engaging content using transitions, effects, and music.<br>
4. <strong>Time Management  </strong>
I believe in balancing productivity with passion. I manage my time by setting daily goals, prioritizing tasks, and creating a routine. This helps me stay focused on studies/work while still enjoying my hobbies like video games, bike riding, and video editing. It keeps me motivated and improves both my creativity and efficiency. <br></p>
